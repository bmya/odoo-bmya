    This module allows to include the county (comuna) as if it were a region. The object of this 
    is to contain all the comunas in a single table.
    One application for this is to allow multiple delivery methods and using a rule by comuna instead
    of adding additional entropy to the module.
    NOTE: DO NOT INSTALL if you don't need to use delivery methods rules based on comunas.
